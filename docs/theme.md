## Theme

### Setting
- GTA-IV-like atmosphere - gritty, dark humor, morally grey
- Fictional mid-sized city
- Mostly urban with industrial zones, some rural outskirts
- Time period: Modern, rust-belt aesthetic

**partly LLM generated slob maybe some ok-ish ideas?**

**Key Locations:**
- **The Docks** - Shipping containers, drug trafficking entry point, smuggling
- **Fight Clubs** - Underground venues, bare-knuckle boxing, betting rings
- **The Gym** - Training ground, meet tough guys, improve skills
- **Slinger Corner** - Street dealing hotspot, turf wars
- **The Projects** - Apartment complexes, where you start out
- **Warehouse District** - Abandoned buildings, secret meetings, stash houses
- **City Center** - Legitimate businesses fronting for crime operations

- **The Pit** - Illegal fighting arena, high-stakes matches

### Protagonist
- **Origin**: Recent immigrant from Eastern Europe (Balkans? Former Soviet state?)
- **Personality**: Not educated, but street-smart when it comes to violence
- **Speech**: Broken English, occasional native language curses
- **Skills**: Naturally strong, good with his fists, terrible with words
- **Motivation**: Came looking for "American Dream", found crime instead

**Character Arc Ideas:**
- Starts as a lookout/muscle-for-hire
- Gains reputation through jobs & fights

### Tone & Atmosphere
- **Dark Comedy**: Absurd situations, gallows humor
- **Moral Ambiguity**: No clear heroes or villains, just survivors
- **Gritty Realism**: Violence has consequences, money is always tight
- **Loneliness**: Protagonist is an outsider, language barrier, no real friends
- **Desperation**: Everyone's trying to climb up, most just fall down

### Factions & NPCs

**The Slavic Crew** (Your people)
- Mix of immigrants from various Eastern European countries
- Tight-knit but small operation
- Focus: Protection rackets, loan sharking, small-time dealing
- Leader: "Uncle" Dmitri - old-school, values loyalty above all

**The Italian Mob** (Traditional power)
- Established, organized, controls the docks
- Respect old rules, despise new crews
- Looking to crush upstarts but losing relevance
- Don: Carmine "The Suit" Rosetti

**The Street Dealers** (Competition)
- Young, reckless, heavily armed
- Control the street-level drug trade
- Aggressive expansion, no respect for territory
- Leader: "Kid" Marcus - charismatic and dangerous

### Progression Themes
- **Physical**: From street brawler to feared fighter
- **Economic**: From broke lookout to earning real money
- **Social**: From nobody to "that guy you don't fuck with"
- **Moral**: From following orders to making hard choices
- **Reputation**: Loyal? Brutal? Crazy?

### Story 
- TBD

### Aesthetic Notes
- **Color Palette**: Greys, browns, washed-out colors
